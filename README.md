# Deep Learning using GPT2
In collaboration with a classmate, we have use a recurrent neural network algorithm called GPT2 in order to generate new synopsis from existing ones.
We have take an input of 4832 synopsis from japanese anime series from the online site MyAnimeList.

In order to execute the code it's necessary to have installed some libraries and frameworks. As well as some specific hardware requirements. Please check all of this in the Documentation section

Next, these are some of the new synopsis that we have obtained:

- *Spoon was a young boy who was sent to a boarding school in England to study at.
He had no idea what to expect when he arrived at the school he had just moved
into. There, he met a beautiful girl named Rita, who had come to stay with him
after his parents had passed away. The two of them decided to start a new life
together in London, where they met many interesting people along the way.*

- _A young man, who has lost his mother in a trafficc accident, finds himself stranded
on a deserted island with only a few of his possessions. There, he is greeted by a
young girl, whose name is Mari, and he quickly falls in love with her. However,
Mari is not the type of girl you would expect from a girl his age: she is actually
a vampire, born with the appearance of a human woman.
Mari soon finds herself drawn into a world of vampires and other supernatural
beings, where she discovers that she has the power to see into the hearts of other
living creatures. As she learns more about the world around her, she also begins
to realize that there is more to this world than meets the eye, as she begins
searching for the reason for her existence._
